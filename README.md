# NHM ROI Calculator

A self contained HTML/CSS/JavaScript ROI calculator—no build tooling or framework required. Open `index.html` directly in your browser or host the files on any static server.

## Using the calculator
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click it or serve the folder from any static host).
2. Adjust the asset count, callout assumptions, or first-fix rates.
3. The annual callouts, avoided visits, and savings figures update instantly.

Everything lives in `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`, so the widget works offline and can be copy/pasted into other pages.
